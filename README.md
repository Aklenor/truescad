# truescad
Truescad is a script based CAD program similar to http://www.openscad.org/.
Unlike OpenSCAD, Truescad uses implit functions to represent geometry and hence offers very precise geometry.

In order to generate meshes, e.g. for 3D-printing, Truescad tessellates the geometry into a mesh with arbritrary precision.
